# zapier-clone-react-app
I've developed a React-based Zapier clone with an admin panel for effortless content management, allowing non-technical administrators to update website content through a user-friendly interface.

# Project Structure
Zapier Clone: This project is about the clone of Zapier Website UI. 

Admin Panel for CMS: This project goes a step further by offering an intuitive admin panel for content management. Non-technical administrators can effortlessly update website content through a user-friendly interface.

No-Code Content Editing: The content of the website is stored in a db.json file. The admin can log in via the admin panel and update website content without writing a single line of code. These changes are instantly reflected on the frontend.
